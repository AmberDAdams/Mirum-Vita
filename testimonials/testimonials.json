Where I was achingly hobbling out of bed in the morning, I now leap up (and I mean literally leaping out of bed).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also on my way to regaining my six pack (and I don‚Äôt mean beer). I cannot recommend Mirum Vita highly enough, she will make you feel NEW. Inside and out."

This took around 6 sessions and it looks totally natural like I‚Äôd been in a gym. This was non invasive and at the fraction of the cost of more advertised clinics. Would highly recommend this treatment."

She often offered her help to me when I was at my lowest mentally and heaviest physically.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often suffered from bouts of depression, low self-esteem coupled with poor eating and drinking habits which then resulted in physical ailments such as joint pain, tendonitis, and other obesity related health issues.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five years of resistance, I finally gave in to my friends and family who recommended her services and I have never looked back. It isn‚Äôt just a session that ends when you leave the warm environment she sets up, there is ongoing support via text and calls when she is available.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is incredibly flexible with times and location (pre COVID of course). She doesn‚Äôt just offer mental and physical help but also assists in curating a lifestyle change.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost over 100lbs since starting with Meredith on a realistic lifestyle change (never hungry but just eating right coupled with exercise) and I can‚Äôt see it ending any time soon. My confidence and attitude to life is somewhere I never thought it could ever be and I see this as the beginning of a long and happy life.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a life to live, you can‚Äôt go wrong with using Meredith and her talent for transforming people‚Äôs lives."
