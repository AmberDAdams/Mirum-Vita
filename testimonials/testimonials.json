Every two weeks I have a facial which has really stopped the rate and the severity of my breakouts. Would definitely recommend both treatments for what you pay!"

This took around 6 sessions and it looks totally natural like I‚Äôd been in a gym. This was non invasive and at the fraction of the cost of more advertised clinics. Would highly recommend this treatment."

I always show up with knots in different muscles and by the end of the session they‚Äôre gone. After every massage Meredith assists with stretches that are difficult to do on your own, and you just leave feeling like you can take on anything.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does she keep me going but she has given me the best advice when it comes to nutrition, skin care and any question I have about my muscles, she always has the answer which has given me a better understanding of my body and how to prevent further injuries."
