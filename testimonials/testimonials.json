I always show up with knots in different muscles and by the end of the session they’re gone. After every massage Meredith assists with stretches that are difficult to do on your own, and you just leave feeling like you can take on anything.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does she keep me going but she has given me the best advice when it comes to nutrition, skin care and any question I have about my muscles, she always has the answer which has given me a better understanding of my body and how to prevent further injuries."

Where I was achingly hobbling out of bed in the morning, I now leap up (and I mean literally leaping out of bed).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also on my way to regaining my six pack (and I don’t mean beer). I cannot recommend Mirum Vita highly enough, she will make you feel NEW. Inside and out."

This took around 6 sessions and it looks totally natural like I’d been in a gym. This was non invasive and at the fraction of the cost of more advertised clinics. Would highly recommend this treatment."

She often offered her help to me when I was at my lowest mentally and heaviest physically.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often suffered from bouts of depression, low self-esteem coupled with poor eating and drinking habits which then resulted in physical ailments such as joint pain, tendonitis, and other obesity related health issues.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five years of resistance, I finally gave in to my friends and family who recommended her services and I have never looked back. It isn’t just a session that ends when you leave the warm environment she sets up, there is ongoing support via text and calls when she is available. She is incredibly flexible with times and location (pre COVID of course).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost over 100lbs since starting with Meredith on a realistic lifestyle change (never hungry but just eating right coupled with exercise) and I can’t see it ending any time soon. My confidence and attitude to life is somewhere I never thought it could ever be and I see this as the beginning of a long and happy life.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a life to live, you can’t go wrong with using Meredith and her talent for transforming people’s lives."

I had seen several doctors and consultants as my toenail was 80% blackened and thick and looked to about to fall off, no diagnosis was made and I was left feeling quite down as a result. Meredith came to see me in regard to another issue, and I mentioned it in passing how my feet made me feel, she did no more, got her kit bag for foot therapy and within 10 minutes had removed this awful black substance that was under the nail, this what was making it discoloured and she filed the dead part of the nail that looked as if it might fall off smooth so in blended in with the rest of the healthy nail! It was that simple, after having test for fungus and all sorts to no avail for more than a year! Can’t thank her enough, she’s just bloody brilliant! Having my foot look normal again had made me feel so much better in myself! A great big thanks!"
