              A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters

              is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to

              remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the
              user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other
              hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web
              browser is closed.
